# Parkinsons Prediction Using Linear Algebra Techniques


## ABSTRACT

This project aimed to develop a Parkinson's disease prediction model using various machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contained various features related to Parkinson's disease symptoms, and the target variable was the patient's UPDRS score, a measure of the disease's severity. The different machine learning techniques utilized in this project included regression, PCA, SVD, SVM, XGBoost, and Random Forest. The models were trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The primary objective was to identify the most accurate model for Parkinson's disease prediction, and the results were compared to determine the model with the least error. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques for improving early diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease.

## DATASET DESCRIPTION 

The dataset used in this project is the Parkinson's Disease Classification Dataset, which contains biomedical voice measurements from 42 people with Parkinson's disease and 42 people without Parkinson's disease. The dataset includes a total of 23 features, including average fundamental frequency, minimum fundamental frequency, maximum fundamental frequency, and several other acoustic measures.

## CONCLUSION 

<p align = "justify">In conclusion, we successfully built a prediction model for Parkinson's disease using various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, PCA, SVD, SVM, XGBoost, and Random Forest. Our models achieved high accuracy in predicting the presence of Parkinson's disease, with XGBoost performing the best at 94.87%.

<p align = "justify">The project also demonstrated the importance of feature extraction and selection, as well as dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and SVD. Confusion matrices and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess the performance of the models. Overall, this project has the potential to assist in early detection and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, leading to improved treatment and management of the disease.


## FUTURE WORK

Future work for this project includes exploring additional machine learning algorithms and techniques that may further improve the accuracy of the model. One potential area for improvement is in the selection of features used in the models. While we have used techniques such as Random Forest to extract the top 10 important features, there may be other methods or algorithms that could be used to select a more optimal set of features.

<p align = "justify"> Another area for future work is in the collection of data. While the dataset used in this project contained various biomedical voice measurements, there may be other types of data that could be collected to improve the accuracy of the model. For example, additional demographic data or medical history could be included to provide more context and potentially improve the accuracy of the model.

<p align = "justify"> Furthermore, this model could be further validated by testing it on larger datasets and in real-world scenarios. Additionally, it would be beneficial to evaluate the model's performance in detecting Parkinson's disease at various stages of the disease progression, as early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management.

<p align = "justify"> In conclusion, this project has demonstrated the potential of machine learning algorithms in predicting the presence of Parkinson's disease using biomedical voice measurements. With further development and improvement, this model could assist in early detection and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, ultimately leading to improved treatment and management of the disease.
